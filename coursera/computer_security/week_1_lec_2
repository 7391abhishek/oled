Memory Layout :
All the static data is known at compile time.


STACK : 
Function Calls : the arguments passed to the function are pushed onto the stack in the reverse order.
All the elements (formal arguments, local variables) : comprise a stack frame, which is pointed to by the frame pointer (%ebp)

A function saves the values of base pointer and the instrunction pointer on the stack before calling another function.
See stack.c for explanation.

Injecting Code on stack : 
1. How to inject code ?
2. How to get the %eip point to it so that it can be executed ?

Injected code : should be machine specific code and cannot contain zeros, otherwise string functions will not copy it.
